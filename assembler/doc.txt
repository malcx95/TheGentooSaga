ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE FOR THE GENTOO SAGA

This is the documentation for the assembly language used for The Gentoo Saga project.
Note that this language is case-insensitive.

1. Standard statements
Ordinary statements are written in the following format (on the same line):

		<instruction> <space, tab and/or comma> <register1> <space, tab and/or comma> <register2 or I-field> ...

Example:	

		ADD			R3, R2, R1		# add R1 and R2 and store in R3
		SFEQI		R1, 0x32		# compare R1 with 0x32

2. Literals
For instructions such as ADDI or SFNEI, the I-literal can be a binary, hexadecimal or decimal
number. For binary, precede the digits with '0b', for example '1010' is written as '0b1010'.
For hexadecimal numbers, precede the digits with '0x', for example '3F' is written as '0x3F'.
Decimal numbers don't need to be preceded with anything, so for example '32' is just written
as '32'. I-fields are always 16-bit, so all numbers will be interpreted as such. Note that this 
means that '0x0000032' and '0b0000000000000001' are equivalent to '0x32' and '0b1', respectively.

3. Registers
Registers are always written as 'R'<0 up to 31>, for example 'R30', 'R1'.

4. Labels
For jump instructions, you need to provide the adress of the place in the program you 
want to go to. You do this using labels. You simply write '<label name>:' in front of the statement you want to jump to, and
then simply refer to it by name. Example:

			JMP			THISROW

			.
			.
			.

THISROW:	do something...

5. Functions
If a certain piece of code needs to be executed in several parts of the programs, you 
can use functions. These work kind of like sub-routines (except when compiled are simply
put as copies to where ever they are called). Unfortunately, you can't conveniently pass arguments
to them, you simply need to keep data in registers or memory where the function knows where it is.
You declare all functions by using the 'FUNC'-keyword and terminate them with 'END'. You call
a function using the 'JFN'-instruction. Example:

					JFN		MYFUNCTION

FUNC MYFUNCTION:	ADD		R1, R2, R3

					.
					.
					.

					END
This is functionally equivalent to putting all the code in the function in place of 'JFN MYFUNCTION'.

6. Comments

'#' or ';' are used as comments. Note that the parser will see 'ADD#' as a comment, so separate them, like this: 'ADD #'

7. Complete instructions

Here are syntax examples for all instructions. Rd is destination, Ra and Rb are A and B registers. I is 
the literal field.

ADD		Rd, Ra, Rb  # Rd <= Ra + Rb

ADDI	Rd, Ra, I	# Rd <= Ra + I

BF		I			# goto label I if f = 1

JMP		I			# goto label I

LW		Rd, Ra, I	# Rd <= Memory(Ra + I)

MOVHI	Rd, I		# Rd(31 down to 16) <= I, Rd(15 down to 0) <= 0

MUL		Rd, Ra, Rb	# Rd <= Ra * Rb

NOP					# Nothing

SFEQ	Ra, Rb		# f <= 1 if Ra = Rb else 0

SFNE	Ra, Rb		# f <= 0 if Ra = Rb else 1

SFEQI	Ra, I		# f <= 1 if Ra = I else 0

SFNEI	Ra, I		# f <= 0 if Ra = I else 0

SW		Ra, Rb, I	# Memory(Ra + I) <= Rb
